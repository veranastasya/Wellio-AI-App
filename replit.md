## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform utilizes a modern design with React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI components. It incorporates a teal (#28A0AE) and lime (#E2F9AD) color scheme, supports dark mode, and uses the Inter font family. Interaction patterns include subtle hover and active elevation states for components. The responsive design ensures usability across various viewports, featuring a collapsible sidebar navigation.

### Technical Implementations
Wellio is built with a React frontend and an Express.js backend. Data is persisted using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM. State management is handled by TanStack Query v5, and form handling uses React Hook Form with Zod validation. Data visualization is powered by Recharts. The system employs UUID primary keys, uses local timezones for date operations, and ensures robust form validation across all inputs. Loading skeletons and error states are implemented for improved user experience. All numeric health metrics (calories, macronutrients, weight, body fat) use the `real` data type to support decimal precision.

### Feature Specifications
- **Dashboard**: Real-time stats, client progress distribution, today's schedule, recent activity, and AI insights.
- **Client Management**: Full CRUD operations for clients, supporting manual entry and questionnaire-based onboarding. Includes client search, progress tracking, status management, and form validation.
- **Questionnaire Builder**: Full CRUD for questionnaires with draft/published workflow. Features a visual builder supporting various question types and customizable form settings. Integrates with client management for intake.

- **Smart Scheduling**: Monthly calendar view for session management, booking forms, and color-coded session types.
- **Communication**: Real-time messaging interface with client conversation lists and message history.
- **AI Insights Dashboard**: Provides personalized, AI-powered trend analysis for nutrition, activity, and progress categories for individual clients. Includes confidence scoring, actionable recommendations generated by OpenAI GPT-4, and visual trend badges. AI summaries now acknowledge synced vs manual data collection.
- **Client Data Logs**: Tabbed interface for recording nutrition, workout, and check-in data, with nullable number fields for accurate data representation.
- **Wearables Integration (ROOK API)**: Two-tier integration architecture supporting 400+ devices. **Web-based ROOK API** handles Garmin, Fitbit, Oura, Whoop, and other devices via OAuth flow. **Native iOS app** handles Apple Health via ROOK iOS SDK with HealthKit integration. Connection request system enables coaches to send invite codes to clients via deep links (wellio://connection-request/{code}). Seamlessly integrated into Client Data Logs page. All data delivered via ROOK webhooks with HMAC signature verification for security. Synced data automatically populates nutrition, workout, and check-in logs with dataSource tracking (manual/rook/apple_health). AI insights recognize and acknowledge wearable data for improved accuracy. Request lifecycle: pending → approved → connected (or rejected/expired), with 7-day expiration.

### System Design Choices
All displayed data is sourced from a robust backend, ensuring 100% authenticity without mock or synthetic data. The system is designed for data accuracy, with calculations like success rate and average progress derived directly from live API data. AI insights leverage OpenAI GPT-4 for sophisticated pattern detection and recommendation generation, requiring a minimum of three data points for trend analysis and incorporating zero-baseline protection.
