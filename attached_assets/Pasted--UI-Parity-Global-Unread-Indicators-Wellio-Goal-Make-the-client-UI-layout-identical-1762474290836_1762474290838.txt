# 🧭 UI Parity & Global Unread Indicators (Wellio)

## Goal
Make the **client UI layout identical to the coach UI** (left-side menu layout), and add a **global unread indicator** on the hamburger/side menu for **both roles** whenever there are unread chat messages.

---

## Scope
- Apply a **shared shell layout** (header + left nav + content) to both **Client** and **Coach** apps.
- Add **unread badges** on:
  - The **Chat** item in the left menu (per-conversation and aggregate states).
  - The **hamburger/side menu icon** itself (global dot/badge) when **any** unread messages exist.

---

## User Stories

### 1) UI Parity: Client Layout Matches Coach
**As a client,**  
I want the same left-side navigation and page structure as coaches,  
so that the app is consistent and easy to navigate.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Client app uses the **same left-side navigation** structure as coach:
  - **Menu (left):** Home, Forms, Chat, Plan/Progress, Settings (labels can be role-appropriate).
  - **Content (right):** Page body content.
- Responsive behavior:
  - ≥1024px: left menu is **fixed**.
  - <1024px: left menu collapses to a **hamburger** that opens a drawer.
- Visual consistency: typography, spacing, iconography, and hover/active states match coach UI.
- No duplication of pages; just **role-based gating** of visibility and permissions.

### 2) Chat Unread: Menu-Level Badges
**As a user (coach or client),**  
I want to see an unread badge on **Chat** in the left menu when new messages arrive,  
so that I know where attention is required.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- **Chat menu item** shows an **unread badge/counter** when any conversation has unread messages.
- If a per-conversation list is visible inside Chat, individual threads show their **own unread counts**.
- Opening a conversation **marks its messages as read** and updates the counters.
- Returning to the menu updates the **aggregate** unread count accordingly.

### 3) Global Unread: Hamburger/Menu Icon Indicator
**As a user (coach or client),**  
I want a small, global visual indicator on the **hamburger/menu icon** when there are unread messages,  
so that I notice new activity even when the menu is collapsed.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- When **any chat** has unread messages, the **hamburger/menu icon** displays a **dot or badge**.
- Indicator clears when **all** unread messages are read.
- Works across breakpoints (desktop collapsed state and mobile).

---

### 4) Real-Time Awareness (Behavioral)
**As a user (coach or client),**  
I want the unread indicators to update **without refreshing**,  
so that the app feels responsive and reliable.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Unread badges (Chat item + hamburger icon) **update in real time** when messages are received or read.
- Offline scenario: indicators **sync** correctly on next load/login.

---

## Navigation & IA (Information Architecture)

**Left Menu (shared shell)**
- Home
- Forms (client: draft + submitted; coach: assigned + received)
- Chat (threads list + unread counters)
- Plan / Progress
- Settings (profile, notifications, security)

**Notes**
- Labels can be **role-specific**, but **placement and interaction** remain consistent.
- Ensure **keyboard navigation** (Tab/Shift+Tab) and **ARIA** labels for accessibility:
  - Hamburger button: `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`
  - Badges: `aria-live="polite"` for unread updates

---

## Visual Design Requirements
- **Badge tokens**:
  - Shape: circular pill for counts, dot for global menu
  - Max count display: `99+`
- **States**:
  - Default, Hover, Active, Disabled
- **Theming**:
  - Uses existing Wellio theme tokens (colors, spacing, elevation).

---

## Success Criteria (Definition of Done)
- [ ] Client UI uses the **same shell** and **left-side menu** as Coach.
- [ ] Chat menu item shows **accurate unread counts**.
- [ ] **Hamburger/menu icon** displays a **global unread indicator** when any unread exists.
- [ ] Indicators **update in real time** and sync after offline sessions.
- [ ] **Responsive** behavior works across desktop/tablet/mobile.
- [ ] **Accessibility**: keyboard navigable, ARIA-compliant for indicators.

---

## Non-Goals
- No new chat features beyond **visibility and indicators** (delivery/read logic is handled in the chat workflow).
- No changes to analytics or notification channels beyond **UI indicators**.
