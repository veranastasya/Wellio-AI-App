Goal:
Ensure that default client fields remain fully consistent across the Client Profile, Questionnaire Builder, Client View, and AI Plan Generation.
All fields listed below must flow seamlessly through the entire system: created → filled out → displayed → stored → synced → passed to AI.

1. Required Default Fields (must exist in BOTH Client Profile Card and Questionnaire Builder)

Each field can be turned ON/OFF in the Questionnaire Builder, but they are part of the default schema.

Unit Selector

Sex (default)

Age (default; can be disabled in the questionnaire)

Weight (default; can be disabled in the questionnaire)

Height (default; can be disabled in the questionnaire)

Activity Level (default; can be disabled in the questionnaire)

Goal (default; can be disabled in the questionnaire)

2. Conditional Goal-Based Fields

Displayed only if a specific goal is selected:

Lose weight → Target Weight (optional)

Improve body composition → Target Body Fat % (optional)

Maintain current weight → Confirm goal weight (auto-prefilled with current; optional)

3. Optional Fields

Body Fat %

Must explicitly display as “Optional” in the Client View.

4. Data Flow Requirements (must be enforced)

The system must support a consistent, lossless data flow:

Questionnaire Builder defines the fields.

Client fills out questionnaire with these fields.

Client View displays the exact same fields, with correct labels and optional flags.

All submitted values sync back into the Client Profile database.

When a coach starts an AI-assisted plan, all synced fields must be passed into the AI model as part of the client context.

5. Acceptance Criteria

Activity Level must sync correctly between Questionnaire → Client View → Client Profile.

All default fields appear in both Client Profile and Questionnaire Builder by default.

Conditional goal fields render only when relevant.

Optional Body Fat % is clearly marked as optional.

No field should exist in one place and not the others.

AI model receives complete, unified client data each time a plan is generated.
