You are building the Reminder & Recommendation Engine UI for the Wellio coaching platform.

Create a front-end layout scaffold (React + Tailwind) that visualizes how reminders and recommendations flow between the client and the coach.

GENERAL STRUCTURE:
The page is split into two main vertical panels:
1) Left: Client Activity Feed & Reminder Rules
2) Right: Coach Recommendation Panel

---------------------------------------------
LEFT PANEL — CLIENT ACTIVITY & REMINDER LOGS
---------------------------------------------
Add the following sections:

1. “Client Engagement Timeline”
   - A vertical feed showing:
     • log events (e.g., “Logged breakfast”, “Completed training task”)
     • inactivity markers (“No activity for 6 hours”)
     • missed tasks (“Task not completed: Training - Monday”)
   - Each event displayed as a card with timestamp and category.

2. “AI Trigger Detection”
   - List triggers detected by the system:
     • Missing meal log
     • No log-ins for X hours
     • Deviation from usual behavior pattern
   - Each trigger card includes:
     • Trigger description
     • Severity (Low/Medium/High)
     • CTA: “Generate Reminder”

3. “Reminder Settings”
   - Controls for notification channels the client enabled:
     • toggle for SMS
     • toggle for Web Push
     • toggle for In-App
   - A frequency slider: how often nudges can be sent.
   - A preview of next scheduled reminder: “Next reminder in: 3 hours”.

---------------------------------------------
RIGHT PANEL — COACH RECOMMENDATION ENGINE
---------------------------------------------
Add the following UI components:

1. “AI Recommendations for Coach”
   - Each recommendation card shows:
     • Reason: e.g., “Client has not logged lunch”
     • Suggested message snippet
     • Buttons:
       - “Send to Client”
       - “Edit Message”
       - “Dismiss”

2. “Quick Actions”
   - Buttons:
     • “Send Check-In”
     • “Ask About Today’s Meals”
     • “Prompt to Log Training”
   - Each action triggers a modal with a templated message.

3. “Auto-Suggestions”
   - Section where the AI proposes follow-ups:
     • Trend detection (e.g., sleep getting worse)
     • Engagement drop
     • Pattern recognition

4. “Channel Simulation”
   - A preview of how the message will appear:
     • SMS preview bubble
     • Web push notification mockup
     • In-app notification card

---------------------------------------------
RESPONSIVE REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------
- On desktop: left and right panels visible side by side.
- On tablet/mobile: right panel collapses into a bottom sheet, left panel becomes primary.
- All components should be built as placeholder or mock components ready for data integration.

---------------------------------------------
STYLE
---------------------------------------------
- Light, minimal UI
- Cards with soft shadows
- Consistent spacing
- Clear hierarchy of severity and actions

Generate the entire scaffold with placeholder data and mock interactions.
