PROMPT START

You are updating an existing fitness coaching platform called Valio.

We already have:

a screen called AI Insights where a coach selects a client and sees their progress

a screen called Client Data Logs where a coach can log data by client (Nutrition, Workout, Check-in/Progress, Goals), but this screen is currently just a mock and nothing is wired up

We need to implement a simple but fully working Progress Tracking feature for the MVP, without wearables integration.

High level goals

Allow both clients and coaches to log progress data.

Ensure all data is shared:

if a client logs something, the coach sees it

if a coach logs something, the client sees it

Store all logs in a unified model and use them as input for an AI analytics module on the AI Insights screen.

AI should compare real data against the client plan (which is already attached/assigned to the client) and produce weekly-level insights and recommendations.

Data model

Create a unified data entity, for example ClientDataLog, stored in the backend or in a simple database layer:

id: string

clientId: string

planId?: string // current plan linked to the client

createdByUserId: string

source: "client" | "coach"

type: "nutrition" | "workout" | "checkin" | "goal"

date: string // logical date of the log

createdAt: string

payload: object with fields such as:

For nutrition:

calories?: number

protein?: number

carbs?: number

fats?: number

comment?: string

For workout:

workoutType?: string

durationMinutes?: number

intensity?: "low" | "medium" | "high"

comment?: string

For checkin / progress:

weight?: number

waist?: number

hips?: number

energy?: number // 1-10

mood?: number // 1-10

sleepHours?: number

comment?: string

progressPhotoUrl?: string (optional, if file upload is available)

For goal:

goalType?: string

goalValue?: string | number

goalStatus?: "active" | "paused" | "completed"

comment?: string

Make sure this data model is reusable for both coach and client flows.

Coach-side UX

Client Data Logs screen

Allow the coach to select a client.

Show a list/table of ClientDataLog entries for that client, grouped by date and by type.

Provide a clear way to add new logs:

Add Nutrition log

Add Workout log

Add Check-in / Progress log

Update Goals

The forms for each log type should match the fields described above.

When the coach submits a form, create a new ClientDataLog with:

source = "coach"

appropriate type and payload

After saving, update the list in real time so the coach sees the new log.

AI Insights screen

Keep the existing structure but wire it to real data:

When a coach selects a client, fetch that client's recent ClientDataLog records for a configurable period, for example the last 7 days by default.

Fetch the client's current plan (calories target, macro targets, workouts per week, steps target, etc.).

Aggregate the logs per period:

Average daily calories vs target.

Average macros vs targets (if available).

Number of workouts vs workoutsPerWeekTarget.

Weight trend (start vs end of period).

Build a prompt for the AI model that includes:

A short description of the client plan.

A structured summary of the actual data from ClientDataLog for the selected period.

A request to:

Assess adherence to the plan.

Point out key issues (undereating, overeating, skipped workouts, fast weight changes).

Provide 3–5 concrete recommendations for the coach and the client.

Display the AI response on the AI Insights screen as:

Summary of progress vs plan.

Key metrics (calories, workouts, weight).

Recommendations list.

Focus on weekly-level analysis, not day-by-day nagging. The default period can be a week, but allow selecting other ranges like 2 weeks or 30 days.

Client-side UX

Create or extend a Progress / Check-in screen in the client app:

The client can:

Add a Nutrition log (calories, macros, comment).

Add a Workout log.

Add a Check-in / Progress log (weight, energy, mood, sleep, comment, optional photo).

See the history of their logs (at least simple list and basic charts for weight and calories).

The UX should be simple and low-friction:

Quick-add buttons like "Add weight", "Add calories", "Add workout".

Reasonable defaults for date (today) with the option to edit.

When the client submits a log, create a ClientDataLog with:

source = "client"

All logs created by the client must immediately be visible on the coach side (Client Data Logs and AI Insights), and logs created by the coach must appear in the client’s history. Optionally mark who created the log (e.g. “added by your coach”).

Technical expectations

Reuse existing components and screens where possible (AI Insights and Client Data Logs).

Implement minimal backend endpoints or local data store to:

Create a ClientDataLog.

Fetch logs by clientId and time range.

Implement a simple AI integration function that:

Receives aggregated data and the client plan.

Sends a prompt to the AI model.

Returns a structured response for AI Insights.

Do not overengineer authentication or permissions. Focus on making the end to end Progress Tracking flow work for:

a client logging data

a coach logging data

AI Insights consuming those logs and the plan for analysis
