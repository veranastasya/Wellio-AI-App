# 💬 Prompt for Lovable — Build Client-Facing Prototype for "Value"

**Goal:**  
Design the **client-facing experience** for the Value platform — the part that clients access when their coach invites them via an onboarding form link or a manual invite.  
The prototype should represent the **end-to-end client journey**, from onboarding to accessing their plan and chatting with their coach.

---

## 👤 Overview

Clients access the app through a **shared token link** (sent by the coach via email).  
Once they log in using the token, they complete the onboarding process and get access to their personal dashboard.

After successful onboarding:
- The client automatically appears on the coach’s dashboard.
- The completed form is attached to the client’s record.

---

## 🧭 Client Flow

### 1. Login / Access
- Clients receive a unique **invite link** from their coach via email.
- The link includes a **secure token** (no password needed).  
- Once opened, the client sees a welcome screen with the coach’s name and a short message like:  
  _“Welcome! Let’s get started with your onboarding so I can build your personalized plan.”_

### 2. Onboarding Form
- Clients complete the **onboarding form** created by the coach.  
  - Supports open text, multiple choice, and checkboxes (similar to Google Forms).  
  - Questions might include fitness goals, schedule, dietary preferences, etc.  
- When submitted, a confirmation screen says:  
  _“Thanks for completing your onboarding! Your coach will review your info and prepare your plan.”_

### 3. Automatic Sync
- After submission:
  - The client automatically appears on the **coach’s dashboard**.  
  - The completed form is attached to their profile.

---

## 🧩 Coach View Connection
- If a coach manually adds a client, that client’s profile card includes an **“Invite Link”** button.  
  - If the client hasn’t been invited yet → show “Send Invite”.  
  - If already onboarded automatically → show a message:  
    _“This client has already been invited and onboarded.”_

## 🏠 Post-Onboarding: Client Dashboard

After onboarding, the client can log in again via the same token link and see:

### 1. My Profile
- Basic info (name, coach name, start date).  
- Summary of goals and any coach notes.  

### 2. My Plan
- A simple structured view of their plan (e.g., workouts, nutrition, or weekly goals).  
- Future versions may include tracking progress or marking tasks as complete.  

### 3. Chat
- Direct chat with the assigned coach.  
- Supports text messages and file uploads (e.g., progress photos, screenshots).  
- The chat history is persistent for each client.

### 4. Forms (optional)
- Clients can view any new forms sent by the coach and fill them directly from here.

## 🧭 Navigation (Client Side)
- My Profile  
- My Plan  
- Chat  
- Forms  

---

## 💡 Design & UX Notes
- Clean, calm interface — simple color palette and intuitive navigation.  
- Keep focus on clarity and trust-building between client and coach.  
- The app should feel personal — show coach name and avatar in key places (welcome, chat, etc.).  
- Include sample data for:
  - One sample client (logged in via token)
  - Example plan
  - One completed onboarding form
  - Example chat messages

## 🎯 Prototype Goal
Demonstrate the **complete client experience**, showing how a client:
> Receives invite → logs in via token → completes onboarding form → gets added to coach dashboard → accesses chat and plan.

---

## 🔒 Future Expansion (optional)
Add a placeholder section in the client dashboard for **AI Insights** (under development), with a locked state:
> “Coming soon — get personalized insights based on your progress.”

*(This prompt should be used to generate the standalone Client View prototype. It must visually and logically connect to the Coach View prototype from the main Value app.)*
