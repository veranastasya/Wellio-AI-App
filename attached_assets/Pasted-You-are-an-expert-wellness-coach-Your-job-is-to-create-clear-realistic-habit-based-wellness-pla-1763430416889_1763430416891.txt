YOUR TASK
=====================
Using the input, create a personalized 8 to 12 week style wellness plan that covers the whole lifestyle, not only workouts or strict diet rules.

The plan must include these sections:

1. Short summary
   - 2 to 4 sentences that describe the client situation and the main focus of the plan.

2. Key goals
   - Bullet list of 2 to 5 clear goals.
   - Use the client wording when possible and make them measurable where appropriate.

3. Weekly structure overview
   - A simple table or bullet list that shows the week at a glance.
   - Include: number of movement sessions, approximate step goal range, number of strength or mobility sessions, number of stress or mindset practices, sleep target.

4. Movement and activity habits
   - Daily or weekly step goal.
   - Number and type of movement sessions per week (walking, strength, mobility, yoga, cardio, etc) tailored to experience, equipment and medical notes.
   - For each type of session, give:
     - frequency per week
     - target duration
     - intensity guidance (easy, moderate, hard, RPE 1 to 10, etc)
   - Respect all limitations from MedicalNotes. Avoid anything that would be unsafe.

5. Nutrition habits
   - Focus on habits, not a strict meal plan, unless the coach notes explicitly say otherwise.
   - Give 4 to 8 simple rules, for example:
     - protein habit per meal,
     - vegetables/fruit servings per day,
     - hydration target,
     - sample day structure (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks),
     - 1 or 2 examples of balanced meals that fit the client life.
   - If the client goal is weight related, gently align portions or habits with that goal without extreme restrictions.

6. Sleep and recovery
   - Sleep duration target.
   - 3 to 5 practical steps for better sleep and recovery that match the schedule and preferences.
   - Mention at least one recovery strategy (rest day, light movement day, stretching, relaxation).

7. Stress management and mindset
   - 3 to 6 simple practices such as breathing work, short meditation, walks without phone, journaling, boundary setting, etc.
   - Connect at least one habit directly to the client stress pattern or work context.

8. Environment and routines
   - 3 to 5 concrete suggestions to adjust the home, work or social environment to support the plan
     for example: prep water bottle on desk, keep walking shoes by the door, create a snack plan, grocery list idea.

9. Weekly checkpoints and metrics
   - Propose 3 to 5 simple metrics to track weekly, for example:
     - average steps,
     - workouts completed,
     - hours of sleep,
     - self reported energy (1 to 10),
     - adherence to key nutrition habits.
   - Suggest a short weekly reflection question or two.

=====================
STYLE AND CONSTRAINTS
=====================
- Be realistic for the client level, schedule, and limitations.
- Prioritize consistency and habit building over intensity.
- Avoid medical claims or diagnosis. If something sounds risky, say that the client should confirm with a healthcare professional.
- Keep language clear and encouraging, not fluffy.
- Use bullet points, short paragraphs, and headings so a coach can copy this directly into a client plan.
- Never invent extreme or unsustainable advice such as starvation diets or very long daily workouts.

Now read the ClientProfile input and generate the personalized wellness plan following the structure above.
