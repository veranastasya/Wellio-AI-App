Update the current UI design while keeping the existing color palette. Improve the look and feel, interaction patterns, responsiveness, and overall visual clarity. Do not change the structure of the pages — only enhance the visual system and component behavior.

What needs to be updated

Tabs

Make it visually clear that these are interactive tab buttons, not plain text.

Strengthen the difference between active and inactive states (clear underline, contrasting background, or more pronounced text weight).

Use a modern, minimal style without heavy borders.

Add a clear hover state.

Focus States

Remove the outdated double-line focus outline.

Replace it with a clean single-outline or soft glow outline (1.5–2 px).

Use the existing palette, but apply cleaner, more modern shades.

Ensure the focus state looks contemporary and consistent across components.

Search Field

Normalize internal padding.

Align the search icon properly.

Add a subtle hover state and a modernized focus outline.

Buttons and Controls

Add a unified set of states: default, hover, active, disabled.

Modernize shadows, border radiuses, and spacing.

Ensure text-to-background contrast meets accessibility standards.

Responsiveness (Mobile Optimization)

Tabs should be horizontally scrollable on smaller screens while maintaining clear active/hover states.

The search bar should stretch fluidly and adjust padding based on viewport size.

Buttons and inputs should reduce padding proportionally on mobile without losing clarity.

Ensure all interactive elements have finger-friendly touch targets (minimum 40–44px).

Avoid layout shifts or overflow issues on narrow screens.

General UI Standards

Unify spacing between sections for a cleaner vertical rhythm.

Keep border radiuses, shadows, and stroke widths consistent.

Apply lighter, softer shadows for a modern look.

Ensure all components feel cohesive, polished, and aligned.

Style Direction

Aim for a clean, modern, minimalist interface similar to Linear, Notion, or Stripe.
Keep all existing colors, but improve contrast, depth, and clarity.

Expected Outcome

A full visual refresh without altering logic or layout structure.
Tabs should look like real tabs. Focus states should be modern. Search and buttons should be polished.
Everything should behave smoothly on mobile and maintain a professional, contemporary look.
