# 🧭 Update "Goal Type" Field: Replace Free Text with Dropdown (Wellio)

## Goal
Replace the existing **free-text “Goal Type” input field** with a **required dropdown selector** across the entire client experience — ensuring consistent goal categorization, easier data tracking, and better analytics alignment for coaches.

---

## Requirements

### 1) Field Replacement
**Current:**  
- Field label: “Goal Type”  
- Type: Free text input  
- Optional  

**New:**  
- Field label: **“Goal”**  
- Type: **Dropdown (select field)**  
- Required: **Yes**  
- Editable: **Yes** — clients can update their goal later via profile or settings.

---

### 2) Dropdown Options
Replace the free-text input with the following preset goal options:

1. Lose weight  
2. Gain muscle / strength  
3. Improve body composition  
4. Maintain current weight  
5. Improve overall health  
6. Eat healthier  
7. Increase energy  
8. Improve fitness / endurance  
9. Reduce stress & improve balance  
10. Improve sleep & recovery  
11. Prepare for an event  
12. Other  

If “Other” is selected → show a small **free text input** field labeled “Describe your goal”.

---

### 3) Validation
- Field is **required** during onboarding and profile editing.  
- User **cannot proceed** without selecting one option.  
- Show inline validation:  
  - Error message: *“Please select your primary goal.”*  

---

### 4) Placement & Consistency
Update the field **everywhere it appears**:

| Location | Update Needed |
|-----------|----------------|
| Client onboarding form | Replace free text with dropdown |
| Client profile / settings | Replace free text field with dropdown + editable option |
| Coach dashboard (client view) | Display the selected goal as a dropdown label |
| Analytics & Insights | Store as a **string value** from the dropdown (no longer arbitrary text) |
| Exports / Reports | Reflect new standardized goal values |

---

### 5) Editing Flow
- Clients can **edit their goal** from their dashboard profile.  
- Show confirmation modal: *“Are you sure you want to change your primary goal? Your progress tracking may be adjusted.”*  
- Coaches see the updated goal in real-time on their side.

---

### 6) Data & Integration
- Store value as `goal_type` in user schema with allowed values from dropdown list.
- Existing clients with free-text goals:
  - Migrate data into `goal_type = 'Other'` + `goal_description = [old text value]`.
- Ensure all downstream components (coach dashboards, analytics, exports) reference the new field type.

---

### 7) UI/UX Notes
- Default state: “Select your goal” (placeholder, not selectable).  
- Dropdown uses Wellio’s standard component styling.  
- Tooltip hint: *“Choose the one that best describes what you want to achieve right now.”*  
- Keyboard and screen reader accessible.
