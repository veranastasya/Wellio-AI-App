## 🔧 Summary
When a coach completes or views a **Client Profile**, they should be able to click **“Start Planning”** to open a **GPT-powered chat interface** that:
1. Automatically loads the client’s data and goals.
2. Allows the coach to converse with an AI assistant to craft a personalized plan.
3. Saves the plan as a **PDF** that can be:
   - Attached to the client profile, and  
   - Shared via chat with the client.

This replaces static templates with a flexible, AI-assisted workflow — keeping the coach in control while leveraging automation for speed and personalization.
