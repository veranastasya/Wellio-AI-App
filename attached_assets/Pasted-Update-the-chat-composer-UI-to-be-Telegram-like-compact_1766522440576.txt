Update the chat composer UI to be Telegram-like (compact and sleek). The current result still looks like a wide, tall form field. Fix it without breaking functionality (send, attachments, emoji).

DO THIS:

1) Make the whole composer ONE tight horizontal row
- Height target: 48px (desktop), 52px max on mobile
- Remove extra vertical padding on the outer wrapper (currently too tall)

2) Pill input should be the centerpiece
- The input container must be a rounded “pill”: border radius 9999px
- The pill should contain:
  - the textarea/input (left side)
  - the emoji button INSIDE the pill on the right side (not outside)
- The pill should visually look like one unit, not separate elements.

3) Icon buttons must be circular and consistent
- Attachment button (paperclip) = circular button, 40px x 40px, centered icon
- Send button = circular button, 40px x 40px, centered icon
- Emoji button = circular or minimal icon button INSIDE the pill, ~32–36px hit target
- All icons vertically centered and aligned.

4) Tight spacing
- Gap between left attachment and pill: 8px
- Gap between pill and send: 8px
- No big margins anywhere.

5) Input behavior
- Use textarea with auto-grow up to 4 lines
- Default state looks single-line
- Enter sends; Shift+Enter new line
- Placeholder stays: “Type a message...”

6) Keep all functionality working
- Clicking paperclip opens attachment menu (image + file) OR directly opens file picker
- Emoji picker opens from the emoji icon and inserts at cursor
- Send works and disables correctly when empty
- Attachments still upload and render correctly

Implementation details (Tailwind targets if using Tailwind):
- Outer composer wrapper:
  - `sticky bottom-0 bg-white border-t`
  - `p-3` (NOT p-6 or large padding)
- Row container:
  - `flex items-center gap-2`
- Attachment button:
  - `h-10 w-10 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center hover:bg-gray-100`
- Input pill container:
  - `flex-1 flex items-center rounded-full border border-gray-200 px-3 h-12`
  - small shadow optional: `shadow-sm`
- Textarea:
  - `w-full resize-none bg-transparent outline-none text-sm leading-5`
  - remove default padding/margins; do not allow it to set the row height
- Emoji button inside pill:
  - `h-9 w-9 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center hover:bg-gray-100`
- Send button:
  - `h-10 w-10 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center`
  - disabled state: `opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed`

Most likely your current code has the emoji and send button OUTSIDE the pill and the wrapper padding/height is too large. Refactor the component so the emoji button is a child of the pill container, and constrain heights as above.

Deliverable:
- Provide the exact code edits for the Composer component (and any small CSS updates).
- Confirm the UI matches the tight Telegram-like row and that sending/attachments/emojis still work.
