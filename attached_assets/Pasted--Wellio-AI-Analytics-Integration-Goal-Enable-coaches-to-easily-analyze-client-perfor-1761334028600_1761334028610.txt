# 🧠 Wellio – AI Analytics Integration

## 🎯 Goal
Enable coaches to easily analyze client performance trends, progress, and behavioral patterns through AI-powered insights.

---

## 🚩 Problem to Solve
Coaches struggle to identify meaningful trends in client data (e.g., progress plateaus, macro deviations, workout consistency) due to manual tracking and fragmented data sources.

---

## 💡 Feature Objectives
Build an **AI Analytics module** that:
1. Automatically processes client data (nutrition, workouts, check-ins) to detect key trends and anomalies.  
2. Provides smart insights and visual summaries (e.g., “Client’s protein intake dropped 12% over the last 3 weeks”).  
3. Suggests next steps or adjustments (e.g., “Recommend increasing carbs by 15g to improve energy output”).  
4. Integrates with existing data imports (MyFitnessPal, FatSecret, manual logs).  
5. Updates the dashboard UI with clear, visualized metrics (graphs, trendlines, insights feed).
