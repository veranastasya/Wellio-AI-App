# Form Builder v1.5 — Make Types Work Like Google Forms (Wellio)

## Goal
When a coach selects a question type, the builder and the client form must render the correct control, collect valid data, and save it. Today everything behaves like short text. Fix that.

---

## Core UX (Coach side)

1) Add question
- Default: Short Answer
- Coach can change Type from a dropdown

2) Configure question
- Fields shown for every question:
  - Label
  - Description (helper text)
  - Required toggle
- Type-specific settings panel below the label

3) Options management (for choice types)
- Inline list of options with:
  - Add option row
  - Reorder via drag handle
  - Delete option
  - Toggle “Other” option
  - Optional default selection

4) Actions on a question
- Duplicate
- Delete
- Drag to reorder
- Collapse/expand

5) Preview
- Live preview on the right mirrors the client form

6) Save
- Autosave changes
- Save Draft and Publish buttons

## Supported Types and Expected Behavior

| Type | Control in client form | Coach settings | Validation defaults |
|---|---|---|---|
| Short Answer | Single line input | Placeholder, character limit | Required, min/max length, pattern (regex allowed) |
| Paragraph | Multiline textarea | Placeholder, character limit | Required, min/max length |
| Multiple Choice | Radio list | Options list, default option, add “Other” | Required forces one selection |
| Checkboxes | Checkbox group | Options list, allow “Other,” min/max selections | Required enforces at least 1, respect min/max |
| Dropdown | Select menu | Options list, default option | Required enforces one selection |
| Number | Number input | Placeholder, unit label, min, max, step | Numeric, range check |
| Date | Date picker | Min date, max date | Valid ISO date within range |

Notes
- All controls use the standard Wellio component library
- All settings are persisted in the question schema
- Client form uses the schema only
