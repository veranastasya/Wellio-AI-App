You are a senior product engineer and UX-minded frontend developer. Implement the “My Plan” client experience with conditional weekly vs program-only behavior. Follow these requirements exactly and do not invent features.

GOAL
Build a Client “My Plan” screen that supports two assignment types:
A) Weekly schedule + Main Program
B) Main Program only (self-paced, no weekly)

PRIMARY UX RULES (non-negotiable)
1) Never show an empty weekly view.
2) Do not show navigation or tabs that do not apply.
3) Coach-defined week start day controls the week layout (client locale must NOT override it).
4) Program is the anchor; weekly is contextual.
5) Clients can navigate to past/future weeks only if those weeks exist.

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
- Screen title: “My Plan”
- If weekly exists, show 2 tabs:
  - “This Week” (default)
  - “My Program”
- If weekly does NOT exist:
  - Hide the “This Week” tab entirely
  - Default to “My Program”
  - Show subtle helper text near the program header:
    “Your coach designed this as a self-paced program. Complete workouts in any order.”

PROGRAM (MY PROGRAM TAB)
- Always available.
- Show a program header card with:
  - Program name
  - Short description
  - Duration label (e.g., “Week 3 of 12” or “12-week program”)
  - Overall program progress (percent + progress bar)
- Below that, show “About this program” section (if description exists).

WEEKLY (THIS WEEK TAB) — only if weekly exists
Weekly header must include:
- Week range label (e.g., “Dec 23 - Dec 29”)
- “Previous Week” and “Next Week” controls
- “Current Week” shortcut
Behavior:
- Previous/Next buttons must be disabled or hidden if there is no previous/next week in data.
- “Current Week” returns to the week containing today (using coach-defined week start).
- Day chips row shows 7 days aligned to coach-defined week start day.
- “Today” badge appears on the chip that matches today’s date (if within the shown week).
- Clicking a day chip loads that day’s plan items.

DAILY CONTENT (weekly view)
For selected day:
- Show “<Day>’s Progress” with:
  - completedCount / totalCount
  - percent complete
- Sections (accordion or cards) for:
  - Training
  - Nutrition
  - Daily Habits
  - Tasks & Check-ins
Only render sections that have items. If a day has zero items total:
- Show neutral empty state: “No scheduled items for today.”
- Do NOT show a progress bar for empty days.

ITEM COMPLETION
- Each item has a checkbox toggle.
- Toggling updates progress immediately and persists.
- Completed items appear visually distinct but readable.

WHOLE-DAY COMPLETION (not displayed yet, but must be supported)
- Backend + state model must support a “Complete Day” action.
- When triggered, all incomplete items for that day become completed and progress becomes 100%.
- If item completion supports undo, this must be reversible.

DATA MODEL (define and use these fields)
Coach settings:
- weekStartDay: one of ["Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun"]

Program:
- programId, programName, programDescription
- totalWeeks (int)
- overallProgressPercent (0-100)

Weekly:
- weeklyEnabled (boolean)
- weeks: array of week objects, each with:
  - weekId
  - startDate (ISO)
  - endDate (ISO)
  - days: array of 7 day objects aligned to coach weekStartDay
Day object:
- date (ISO)
- sections: { trainingItems[], nutritionItems[], habitItems[], taskItems[] }
Item object:
- itemId, title, metadata (sets/reps/time optional), coachNote optional
- completed (boolean)

DERIVED LOGIC
- weeklyExists = weeklyEnabled AND weeks.length > 0
- Default tab:
  - if weeklyExists => "This Week"
  - else => "My Program"
- Week date range must be computed from coach weekStartDay.
- Only allow navigating to weeks that exist in `weeks`.

DELIVERABLES
1) Implement the UI with responsive layout similar to modern fitness apps.
2) Implement state handling for tab selection, week navigation, day selection, and completion.
3) Ensure conditional rendering matches UX rules (no empty weekly screens, hide non-applicable tab).
4) Include clean component structure: PlanHeaderCard, Tabs, WeekNavigator, DayChips, DayProgress, SectionList, PlanItemRow.

IMPORTANT
- If weeklyExists is false, do not show weekly header, week navigator, or day chips at all.
- Do not invent extra pages. Everything stays within “My Plan” with conditional UI.
