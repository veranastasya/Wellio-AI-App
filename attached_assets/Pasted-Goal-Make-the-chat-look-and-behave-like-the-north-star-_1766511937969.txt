Goal: Make the chat look and behave like the north star:
1) 2-column layout
   - Left sidebar: fixed width (~320px), contains “Messages” title + search input + conversation list.
   - Main pane: full remaining width, contains header, message thread, and composer.
   - Entire page height = 100vh, no weird extra whitespace.

2) Main pane structure (top to bottom)
   - Header (sticky): avatar + client name + online status on the left; “Switch to Client View” button on the right.
   - Message thread (scrollable): takes all remaining vertical space between header and composer.
   - Composer (sticky bottom): attachment icon, optional image icon, text input, emoji icon, send button.

3) Message bubbles
   - Incoming (client) bubbles: aligned left; white background; subtle border; rounded corners; max width 60–70% of the thread width; consistent padding; timestamp below/inside in smaller muted text.
   - Outgoing (coach) bubbles: aligned right; teal background; white text; same max width rules; consistent padding; timestamp in smaller text.
   - Add consistent vertical spacing between messages (e.g., 12–16px).
   - Prevent “tiny bubble stuck in the middle” behavior: bubble width should fit content but never exceed max width; the container should span full width so alignment works.

4) Scrolling + layout rules (this is likely the bug)
   - The message thread must be the ONLY scrollable area in the main pane (overflow-y-auto).
   - Header and composer must not scroll away (sticky/fixed within the main pane).
   - Ensure no parent container is accidentally constraining the thread width (avoid max-w-sm on the whole thread, avoid inline-block wrappers that shrink the layout).
   - Use a flex column layout for the main pane: `display: flex; flex-direction: column; height: 100vh;`
     Header: `flex: 0 0 auto`
     Thread: `flex: 1 1 auto; overflow-y: auto;`
     Composer: `flex: 0 0 auto`

5) Responsiveness
   - Desktop: sidebar visible.
   - Smaller screens: sidebar can collapse or overlay (simple approach is fine), but the main pane must still keep header/thread/composer structure.

Implementation requirements:
- Use the existing stack in the repo (React + Tailwind if present; otherwise plain CSS is fine, but be consistent with the codebase).
- Do not redesign colors or typography beyond what’s needed to match the north star.
- Identify the exact components/files responsible (e.g., ChatPage layout, ConversationList, MessageList/Thread, MessageBubble, Composer).
- Provide a clear set of code edits (actual code), not just advice.

Steps you must follow:
A) Inspect current components and find why the thread is not using full width and why bubbles are floating in a narrow column (likely a container width or display rule).
B) Refactor layout to the flex column model described above.
C) Update message bubble components to enforce max-width and alignment reliably.
D) Verify: long messages wrap correctly; thread scrolls; composer stays pinned to bottom; no massive empty whitespace; looks like the north star screenshot.

Deliverable:
- A patch-style response with the updated code for the relevant files/components and a short explanation of what caused the issue and what you changed.
