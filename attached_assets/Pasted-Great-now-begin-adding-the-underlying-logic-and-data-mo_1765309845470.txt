Great — now begin adding the underlying logic and data models for the Engagement system, still using mock or simulated data, but structured in a way that we can later connect real APIs.

1. Create data models (TypeScript interfaces or mock schemas) for:
   - ClientActivityEvent (timestamp, type, category, metadata)
   - Trigger (id, type, severity, detectedAt, reason, recommendedAction)
   - Recommendation (id, message, reason, status, createdAt)
   - NotificationPreference (sms, webPush, inApp, frequency)
   - QuickAction (id, label, template)

   Store these in a `/models` directory.

2. Add lightweight logic functions with mock outputs:
   - detectTriggers(activityFeed)
   - generateRecommendation(trigger)
   - simulateNotificationSend(recommendation)
   - getMockActivityFeed(clientId)
   - getMockNotificationPreferences(clientId)

   These functions should live in a `/logic` directory.

3. Integrate these logic functions into the UI:
   - The Activity Timeline should load from getMockActivityFeed()
   - The Trigger List should run detectTriggers() on that feed
   - Recommendation cards should be generated by generateRecommendation(trigger)
   - “Send to Client” should update the recommendation status and fire simulateNotificationSend()

4. Add temporary in-memory state management:
   Use Zustand or a simple React context to store:
   - activityFeed
   - triggers
   - recommendations
   - notificationPreferences

   This prepares the system for future backend integration.

5. Add simple console logging for major events:
   - When a trigger is detected
   - When a recommendation is generated
   - When a reminder is “sent”
   - When notification preferences change

6. Return an updated summary of:
   - created models
   - created logic functions
   - how the UI is now wired to the mock logic
   - what the next step should be for backend integration.

The goal here is to move from a static UI to a simulated, functional Engagement system that behaves like the real one but still runs fully on mock data.
